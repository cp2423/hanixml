This is an example of just one way of structuring code to make it cleaner. It uses:

* wrapper classes eg `HesaReport` and `Student` classes. These act a bit like entities in a data model.
* separate `.py` files for different parts of the program. This helps keep `main.py` clean and easy to understand for humans.
